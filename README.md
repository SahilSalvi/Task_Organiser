# Task_Organiser

It's a simply application for adding and deleting your day to day task, more feature will be added in the application once ready.

Sqlite is used for database, and tkinter for GUI First we have to run the tmDB in the environment and then the CLI check the output for both then execute the GUI file.

If we click on particular task it should start a timer beside it, this feature is not yet integrated, for the time being if double clicked on the particular task it deletes the task. Once the timer is ready it will be replaced by the deleting a task on double click.
